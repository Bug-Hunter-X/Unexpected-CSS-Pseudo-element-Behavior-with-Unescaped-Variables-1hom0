The CSS code has an unexpected behavior when a pseudo-element (like ::before or ::after) is used with content that contains a variable or expression that is not properly escaped or handled.  This can lead to unexpected rendering, particularly if the variable contains characters that are interpreted as CSS properties or values. For example, if a variable contains a single quote or double quote that isn't properly escaped, it could prematurely terminate the content string and cause unexpected results.
